**1)** Consider the class declaration below:

  // Is this possible?
  
    public class Lion extends Mammal, Carnivore {
        // ...
    }
  
  - Explain why the following class declaration is not possible in Java.
  - What are the limitations of the extends key word?
  - How can you accomplish this inheritance structure task in Java?

The following class declaration is not possible because you cannot extend multiple classes at once.  
The limitation is that oyu can only extend one class at a time.

**2)** What are some of the functional differences between an abstract class and an interface? Use the example below to answer this question.

    public abstract class Employee {
        // ...
    }
    
    // vs.
    
    public interface Employee {
        //...
    }

- The difference between an abstract class and an interface is that in an abstract

**3)** Consider the interfaces for a Stack and Queue of ints.

    public interface Stack {
       public void push(int v);
       public int pop();
       public int peek();
    }
    
    public interface Queue {
       public void enqueue(int v);
       public int dequeue();
       public int peek();
    }
Now suppose you had a LinkedList implementation to store ints with the following methods defined.

    public class LinkedList implements Stack, Queue {
      public LinkedList() {/*...*/}
      public void addToFront(int v) {/*...*/}
      public int rmFromFront() {/*...*/}
      public void addToBack(int v) {/*...*/}
      public void rmFromBack() {/*...*/}
      
      //FINISH HERE

       public void push(int v) {
           addToFront(v);
       }
       public int pop() {
           return rmFromFront();
       }
       public int peek() {
       int front  = rmFromFront();
       addToFront(front);
       return front;
       }
       
       public void enqueue(int v) {
           addToFront(v);
       }
       public int dequeue() {
           rmFromBack();
       }
  
}
Using those methods in LinkedList complete the realization of a Stack and Queue:
